Greetings, earthlings!

My name is Yvo, and I am a force to be reckoned with in the world of cloud computing. No all jokes aside, I am an AWS Cloud Consultant at [Cloudar](https://www.cloudar.nl), I spend my days architecting and building high-available environments that are as sleek as they are secure. Whether I am using Infrastructure as Code or Continuous Integration and Delivery, I am always looking for creative solutions that solve even the most challenging problems.

As a proud AWS Cloud Consultant and AWS Community Builder, I am passionate about helping customers or people in general on their cloud journey from start to finish. Whether they need a Landing Zone designed or a DataLake created in AWS, I am the go-to guy for all things cloud-related. And when it comes to development tools, I am a master at using them to speed up the deployment process and get things done in record time. But do not let my cloud expertise fool you – I am also a devoted husband and father of three amazing kids. When I am not busy revolutionizing the cloud computing world, you can find me spending quality time with my son, Nev and my little girl, Reeva.
